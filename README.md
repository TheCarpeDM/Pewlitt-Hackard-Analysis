# Pewlitt-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
This analysis is to provide Bobby's manager at Pewlett-Hackard data on how they should prepare for the "silver tsunami" of retirements coming up this year. 

## Results
-72,458 employees are at or close to retirement age. 
-50,842 of those employees have "Senior" in their title.
-1,550 employees are currently eligible for the Mentorship Program. 
-Only 2 Managers are approaching retirement age, but there are 0 Managers eligible for the Mentorship Program.

## Summary
In order to maintain employee numbers, Pewlett-Hackard will need to hire another 72,458 employees (as shown in the [Retiring Titles(Resources/Data/retiring_titles.csv)]) to replace the ones likely to leave during this "silver tsunami". Over the next few years, Pewlett Hackard should plan for 25,916 Senior Engineers, 9,285 Engineers, 1090 Assistant Engineers, 24,926 Senior Staff, 7,636 Staff, 3,603 Technique Leaders, and 2 Managers to be retiring.
As long as every mentor that is eligible is willing to take about 50 new employees each (math is in the [Mentorship Eligibility sheet(mentorship_eligibility.csv)]), there will be enough mentors for the new hires, discounting managers (only 2 managers are potentially retiring). 
Further queries could sort the retirees by the year they become eligible to further break down the likely retirements by year, and further data on mentor eligibility could be acquired by using a query organizing the potential mentors by department and by length of tenure (sorting by the date they started their current position).
